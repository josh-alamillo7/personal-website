    <h2>Full-Stack App</h2>
        <h3>Dancer Data Retriever ðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ</h3>
        <p>By far my favorite application that I have built, since it involves heavy handling of data from a video game (Dance Dance Revolution) that has played a major role in my life, including being one of the reasons I started programming. My app scrapes data from about 1600 HTML pages and allows a user to
        both store their own scores, and, using the scraped data, to see their where their scores fall on the player spectrum using some nice graphs.</p>

    <h2>Mini-Game App</h2>
        <h3>Block Barrage ðŸ‘‡ðŸ€† </h3>
        <p>An addictive block game based on "Mario's Puzzle Party" from the Mario Party series. Building this application using React was very logic-heavy, so required thorough testing as I built each step of the logic.</p>
