    <h2>Back-end/Full-Stack Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>SilverSpoon 🥄</h3>
        <p>A system-design project aiming to optimize a service resembling the reservations component of an Open Table-like service. The project had three goals in mind:
          <ol>
            <li>
            Generate scripts to seed a database with at least 10 million restaurants and 10 million reservations in as little time as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optimize the time it takes for the service to send a GET request to the server and query the database for a JSON response containing all available reservation slots.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use benchmarking, stress testing and server optimization technologies such as caching to allow the server to comfortably handle 1000 requests per second with minimal latency.
          </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>Techs used: React, Node, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Artillery, Redis, New Relic, Jest</p>
      </li>

        <h3>Cheerdango 🎥</h3>
        <p>A front-end focused team project with the purpose of creating a shallow version of a Fandango-like webpage, combining all four individual services using a proxy server, and deploying each component and the combined product using AWS. To give the website a realistic feel, the group generated mock data for 100 movies and in my case, 10 reviews per movie.</p>

        <p>Tech stack: React, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Jest, AWS Beanstalk, CircleCI</p>
      </li>
